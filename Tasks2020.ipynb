    "This function uses continued fractions to calculate a rational number that is an approximate value of the square root of 2 [1](#ref1). It uses a recursive algorithm to calculate and refine the numerator *p* and denominator *q* of the approximate value step by step for a number of iterations **its** (200 in this case for a very accurate approximation). The algorithm is as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "The function then takes the final calculated values for *p* and *q* and uses a long division algorithm to calculate digits of the square root of 2 decimal by decimal. This algorithm is a computational implementation of pen-and-paper long division. The algorithm has 5 steps:\n",

    "5. Repeat for **prec** number of digits (100 in this case).\n",
