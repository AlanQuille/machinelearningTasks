# Machine Learning and Statistics Tasks 2020
This repository contains this README.md file, a gitignore file, the Jupyter notebook Tasks2020.ipynb and a HTML version of said notebook called Tasks2020.html. The tasks in the notebook are ordered from 1-4.

In the notebook, unless referenced the algorithms are not taken from an external source. The tasks are fundamental so they are probably not original but they are not copied.
